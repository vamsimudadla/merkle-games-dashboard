# Code Assignment - Game API

**Technology stack:** Nuxt & REST API

## Objective

Develop a responsive Nuxt/TypeScript web application that allows users to explore games using the provided REST API endpoints. The solution must meet functional, technical, and accessibility standards, and be optimized for usability and performance.

You will need to run the Games API locally for this assignment. Ensure you have access to the "Merkle Games API" container project or the provided zip file. API documentation is available in the container project once running.

## Time Allocation

**Allocate approximately 1 to 4 hours to complete the task.** Focus on fulfilling the essential requirements before attempting any optional enhancements. The purpose of this assignment is not to deliver a flawless and complete product, but to provide a foundation for discussion. We are particularly interested in your reasoning, project structure, and coding decisions. Please indicate the total time you spent on the assignment, as this will help us understand the scope of your effort.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Understanding of assignment
- Fulfillment of functional requirements and understanding of acceptance criteria
- Code quality and maintainability
- Visual design and user experience
- Responsiveness
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance and optimization
- Test coverage
- Documentation quality

## Submission Instructions

Submit your completed project in a public GitHub repository. The provided "Merkle Games API" project already contains the following structure:

- /server (API container)
- /client (your application goes here)
- README.md

Place your application in the /client folder. Ensure the repository includes:

- All relevant project files
- An updated README.md with setup instructions
- A brief explanation of your implementation approach and choices

Include the GitHub repository link in your submission.

## Use of External Tools

This assignment is intended to evaluate your individual coding skills, problem-solving approach, and architectural decisions. **Please do not use AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or similar) to generate code or structure the solution**. Likewise, avoid copying large portions of code from existing repositories or online sources.

We are not assessing prompt engineering or AI-assisted development. The focus is on your own implementation, so we can have an informed discussion about your choices, strengths, and potential fit for the role. Assignments developed with vibe coding will be disqualified as that it not the purpose of the assignment.
